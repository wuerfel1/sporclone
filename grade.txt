Project #9: Sporclone


Final grade:

Your grade on this project will be based on acquiring a review of each game and making
changes to your game if the review indicates it is necessary and playing the games of
at least 5 different students.

I will verify the reviews prior to giving credit. You will lose 1 point for each item on
the checklist that is not met. All reviews and your play long must be submitted by May 6.
Each late item will result in a 5-point deduction.

Also don't forget that at least one game must be image based, one must contain at least
20 questions, and no game may have fewer than 10 questions. It is okay if the image-based
game is also the 20-question game.
