Review: (If you don't check an item, explain in comments.)

[ ] The layout of the answers table is organized and pleasing. If there is a logical
    order to answers, then the table displays answers in order. If the game is image-
    based, then images should be scaled consistently and it should be clear which
    blank is associated with each image.

[ ] The time limit is appropriate for the topic and number of questions. A moderately-
    skilled typist should be able to enter all answers within the time limit. If not
    all answers are known, the wait for the timer to run out so answers are displayed
    should not be excessively long. The time limit should require the player to
    actually have knowledge of the topic and not just be able to Google answers.

[ ] Answers appear to be accurate and researched thouroughly. Double-check any answers
    that seem like they may be incorrect or misspelled.

[ ] It is not excessively frustrating to guess the format of the answers when you
    actually know the answer. 


Game features: (Not all items need to be checked)

[ ] This game is image-based.
